# simpleaudio2
simpleaudio2 is a Plugin for CKeditor5, that provides HTML5 Audio.

# Build from source
When building CKEditor5 from source, You can add SimpleAudio to allow inclusion of mp3 Audio in HTML generated by CKEditor5.

Proceed as follows:
1. add "@anbrusi/ckeditor5-simple-audio": "github:anbrusi/simpleaudio2" to the dependencies in package.json and install it by calling npm update
2. import SimpleAudio in your main js file like: import SimpleAudio from '@anbrusi/ckeditor5-simple-audio';
3. add SimpleAudio to builtin.plugins
4. add simpleAudio to defaultConfig.toolbar.items

Audio files are stored separately and referenced in the HTML audio element. Therefore an upload mechanism is required. We use SimpleUploadAdapter.

Proceed as follows:
1. Import SimpleUploadAdapter in Your main js file like: import { SimpleUploadAdapter } from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-upload'; Usually it is not necessary to install it on its own.
2. add SimpleUploadAdapter to builtin.plugins
3. add the configuration simpleUpload: { uploadUrl: '.isUpload.php' } to default config. This uses isUpload.php for the server side, but You can write the server side yourself.

You can find isUpload.php in @anbrusi/ckeditor5-simple-audio/sample.
